      <p>I will pursue a career in client-side development. I enjoy the process of
        making someone else' idea a reality utilizing my own unique skills, and
        working with them until it is better than they imagined. While I wish to
        find a position within a company or firm, I plan to pursue this as an
        independent developer as well. As a secondary goal, I will also be joining
        a cabal of like-minded friends who are already at work on an interactive
        media start up.

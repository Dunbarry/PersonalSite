  <p>I will pursue a career in client-side development. I enjoy the process of
    making someone elseâ€™s idea a reality utilizing my own unique skills, and
    working with them until it is better than they imagined. While I wish to
    find a position within a company or firm, I plan to pursue this as an
    independent developer as well. As a secondary goal, I will also be joining
    a cabal of like-minded friends who are already at work on an interactive
    media start up.</p>

      <h3> A little about myself... </h3>
  <p>Through Middle and High School I indulged my natural talent for music
    and writing, while exploring my interest in sciences. I strove to learn as much
    as I could about those subjects, both in and out of school, because they spoke
    to me. While working as a sessionist3 after high school, I held a day
    job at a local golf course. My employer saw the makings of golf course
    superintendent in me: Strong communications skills, a knack for problem
    solving, and a mind for science. When I decided it was a career I wanted to
    pursue, he endorsed my application to Michigan State University's Turf
    Management Program.</p>

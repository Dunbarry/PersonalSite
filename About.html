      <h3> A little about this theme... </h3>
  <p>I call this theme 'Intelligent Paper'. A nod to smart phones and cars and
    our ever growing managerie of 'smart'technology. The idea is for the page to
    look two dimensional until interacted with. At which point it comes off the
    page to greet you. Right now, of course it's in a very basic form, but I
    plan to expand on it as my skills grow!</p>

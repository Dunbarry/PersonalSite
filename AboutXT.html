      <h3> A little about myself... </h3>
  <p>Despite having little prior knowledge, I found great success working in the
    Chicago area golf course industry after graduating in 2008. As a golf course
    superintendent, problem solving is an indispensable skill. One must be able
    to evaluate the symptoms in order to determine their source, and then treat
    that source. Often the core of a plantâ€™s problem is at its root, meaning you
    must be able to recognize the signs, and then be willing to dig down to the
    heart of the problem. In many ways this mirrors the skills and drive
    necessary for coding and development work. One must be willing to dig for a
    diagnosis, and work for a solution.</p>

    <h3> A little about myself... </h3>
<p>Through Middle and High School I indulged my natural talents as a musician
  and writer, while exploring my interest in sciences. I strove to learn as much
  as I could about those subjects, both in and out of school, because they spoke
  to me. While working as a part-time musician after high school, I held a day
  job at a local golf course. My employer saw the makings of golf course
  superintendent in me: Strong communications skills, a knack for problem
  solving, and a mind for science. When I decided it was a career I wanted to
  pursue, he endorsed my application to Michigan State University's Turf
  Management Program.</p>

<p>Despite having little prior knowledge, I found great success working in the
  Chicago area golf course industry after graduating in 2008. As a golf course
  superintendent, problem solving is an indispensable skill. One must be able to
  evaluate the symptoms in order to determine their source, and then treat that
  source. Often the core of a plantâ€™s problem is at its root, meaning you must
  be able to recognize the signs, and then be willing to dig down to the heart
  of the problem. In many ways this mirrors the skills and drive necessary for
  coding and development work. One must be willing to dig for a diagnosis, and
  work for a solution.</p>
